As noted, I am a student. I would not be where I am today without
the health problems I was faced with in the past. As much as one
would believe a near death experience would be a curse, I believe
it was a blessing in disguise. If it wasn’t for the struggles I went
through with my health, I wouldn’t be so passionate about wanting to
help others. I work as a paramedic at Woodland Hills EMS, which is
located in the Eastern Suburbs of Pittsburgh. I also work as a
paramedic at St. Margaret’s Hospital in the Emergency Department.
I really enjoy both jobs; however I enjoy health coaching the most.
I get the most self-satisfaction out of helping others find their
own inner healer within them.
